# AlyCompiler's TODO

- [x] Lex source into tokens or something

- [ ] Parse tokens or something into AST -- Just a tree containing data about the program

- [ ] Compile AST into assembly, let's start with x86_64? We could also transpile into another language that then gets compiled, like C or something.

# Dumb ideas that we could implement

# -- Miscellaneous

    - Unnamed variable declarations
        - It would be cool if an assignment and/or variable declaration could have no identifier, and work on a singular unnamed variable in the environment.
