# AlyCompiler's TODO:

- [ ] Lex source into tokens or something

- [ ] Parse tokens or something into AST -- Just a tree containing data about the program

- [ ] Compile AST into assembly, let's start with x86_64? We could also transpile into another language that then gets compiled, like C or something.
