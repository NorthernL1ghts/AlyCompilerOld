* AlyCompiler

I don't really have a plan — I just want to make a compiler; it sounds fun.
There's an example of some code that should be valid and compilable in the [[file:example][example]] file.

* About Aly

Aly is a programming language designed with precision and efficiency in mind.
The name *Aly* stands for *Analytic Lexical Yield*, reflecting its focus on analytical processes and lexical clarity.

But beyond its technical roots, Aly is also a personal tribute — named after my partner, *Alyssa*, whose support and inspiration have shaped the journey of this project.

The *AlyCompiler* is the compiler that powers the language, translating Aly code into executable instructions with optimal performance.

Whether you're exploring new programming paradigms or just curious about the design, Aly offers a fresh take on the world of programming languages.

* Usage

Run the executable from a shell, passing a path to some source code as the only argument.

Currently, the compiler prints out how far it gets through the compilation process.
Eventually, it will emit compiled code.

* Building Instructions

** Dependencies
- [[https://cmake.org/][CMake]] (Version 3.14 or later)
- [[https://gcc.gnu.org/][GCC]] or any C compiler (Clang, MSVC, etc.)

** 1. Generate the Build Tree

#+begin_src sh
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B bld
#+end_src

** 2. Build the Executable

#+begin_src sh
cmake --build bld
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can use the platform-specific scripts:

- Windows: ~Scripts/Win-GenerateProject.bat~
- Linux/macOS: ~Scripts/GenerateProject.sh~
